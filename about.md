Currently, I am working on improving my skills with a number of MOOCs and projects related to data analysis and machine learning. More broadly, I am interested in how tools like these can be used to solve real problems.

If you have a project where I can help, or something you would like to discuss, please be in touch!

My background is in mathematics and in research. Doctor of science (technology) from 2007, Helsinki University of Technology (currently Aalto University). My old academic homepage including links to my publications can be found [here](https://math.aalto.fi/~fdahl/index.html).

This homepage is build using Jekyll by adapting the [Vida](https://github.com/syaning/vida) theme.
